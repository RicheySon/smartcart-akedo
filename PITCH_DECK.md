**Q&A Prep (1 minute):**
Common questions to prepare for:
- "How does the AI prediction work?" → Usage patterns + historical data
- "What about privacy?" → End-to-end encryption, no cloud storage
- "Business model?" → Freemium (basic free, premium features $4.99/month)
- "Why not just use existing apps?" → They don't have AI predictions + budget validation
- "What was the biggest challenge?" → Integrating real-time predictions with budget constraints

Good luck! 🚀
